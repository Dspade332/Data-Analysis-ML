# About

Hello,  my name is osama and mainly my interest lies in understanding the complex relation that links cause and effect and to that end i learn data analysis and data science.

# What's in here ?

a collection of ML projects ive worked on, some from data collected from popular scarpping websites like Inside Airbnb or data from kaggle datasets(mostly just raw data pulled from APIs).

I usually focus on the defining the problem, data building process, data analysis and the model building process.

the rest of my projects can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/osamayassen/code
